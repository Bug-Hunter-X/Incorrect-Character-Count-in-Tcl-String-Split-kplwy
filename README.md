This repository contains a Tcl code example demonstrating an uncommon bug related to character counting using the split command with an empty string. The bug arises when the code attempts to split a string into individual characters using split "" and then iterate through the resulting list to count the characters. This approach fails to handle multi-byte characters correctly, leading to an inaccurate character count. The bugSolution.tcl file provides a corrected version that addresses the issue.  The issue is primarily caused by the assumption that split "" will always produce a list where each element represents a single character, which is not true for multi-byte character encodings such as UTF-8.
